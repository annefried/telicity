<!-- Settings:
genre:  genre-based cross validation, folds are defined by genres
        feature 'document_genre' must be available in data
withinGenre: execute x-Fold cross validation within each genre
        (less folds are used if a genre has fewer documents than numFolds)
xFold:  x-fold cross validation, will take numFolds into account
test:   regular test and train setting, folder with ARFFs must contain
        a dev and a test folder.
learningCurve: will create a learning curve using 10/20/.../90/100% of
        training data and x-Fold cross validation (make sure to configure
        unigrams as bigrams don't work with downsampled data!)
