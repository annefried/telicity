Experiments have been done using the feature extraction and experiment code of the Situation Entities system.
You need to clone https://github.com/annefried/sitent as well and make sure the reference in the POM is correct
so all relevant classes can be found.

The folder "config_files" contains the configuration files for the class "Experiment" in sitent.classifiers
that can be used to run the experiments.
