## Experiments

We provide standoff-annotations in the folder telicityData/interCorp_annotations_standoff. They contain the original InterCorp sentence IDs.

In order to create the complete training data that can be used as direct input to our system, run PrepareInterCorp.java with appropriate input parameters (see file).
